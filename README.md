# Tic-Tac-Toe
My first project in my Fullstack Developer course.

Also my first expirience with Git and Github.
Having a lot of fun working on this project ,
and hoping to make it better.

## This project is Written in pure html/css/js
I wrote all of the code and logic apart from some css for button design.
The code here is not perfect but it was fun and i learned from it a lot.

You can play against a simple Computer logic,
you can change the grid for an interesting experience.
and the past part is HARD MODE! i really suggest you give it a try!

let me know what you think!

There is a live demo here:
